[v1\.118\.0]()

*📌 v1\.118\.0*

Welcome to release `v1\.118\.0` of Immich\. This version comes with several breaking changes, and also improvements to the mobile app UI and UX, a new documentation home page, as well as bug fixes and enhancements across the app\. We hope you enjoy this release\!

>\[\!WARNING\]
>*✏ Breaking changes*
>This release includes the following breaking changes:
>1\. Port alignment
>2\. Remove deprecated API endpoints
>3\. Remove deprecated `start\.sh` arguments

*📚 1\. Port alignment*
We aligned the internal port of the `immich\-server` to be similar to the binding port\. Please make the following change to your `docker\-compose\.yml` file under the `immich\-server` section\. Reverse proxies using port 3001 also need to be updated to use port 2283\.

```diff
services:
  immich\-server:
    container\_name: immich\_server
    \.\.\.
    ports:
\-    \- 2283:3001
\+    \- 2283:2283
    \.\.\.
```

*📚 2\. Remove deprecated API endpoints*
The following endpoints were previously deprecated and have been removed, if you are a community project maintainer and using one of the endpoints below, please make sure to make changes to your project:
⦁ `/api/server\-info/\*` has been removed\. Use `/api/server/\*` instead\.
⦁ `/api/people/:id/assets` has been removed\. Use `/api/search/metadata` instead\.

>\[\!NOTE\] 
>This includes `/api/server\-info/ping`, `/api/server\-info/version`, `/api/server\-features`, `/api/server\-info/config`, `/api/server\-info/statistics`, and others\.

*📚 3\. Remove deprecated `start\.sh` arguments*
The following docker commands have been removed:
⦁ `start\.sh immich`
⦁ `start\.sh microservices`

Follow the steps below to align `docker\-compose\.yml` with the default setup\.

**>\[\!NOTE\] 
>These steps are only required if you still have the `immich\-microservices` section in your `docker\-compose\.yml` or didn't follow the previous instructions to remove the command section\. If you don't have the mentioned content below, you can ignore this||


*🔖 1\. Update `docker\-compose\.yml`*


Remove the `command` line from `immich\-server` and the entire `immich\-microservices` service section as shown below\.

```diff
services:
  immich\-server:
    container\_name: immich\_server
    \.\.\.
    :
\-   command: \[ "start\.sh", "immich" \]
    \.\.\.

\-  immich\-microservices:
\-    container\_name: immich\_microservices
\-    \.\.\.
\-    :
\-    command: \[ "start\.sh", "microservices" \]
\-    \.\.\.
```

*🔖 2\. Remove the running `immich\-microservices` container*
Run `docker compose down \-\-remove\-orphans` after updating `docker\-compose\.yml` to remove the old `immich\-microservices` container\.

*✏ Highlights*

Some of the highlights for this release include the following:

⦁ Mobile UI/UX improvement
⦁ Option to refresh face detection
⦁ Color filters for editing photos
⦁ Timezone improvements
⦁ Deprecated release notes section
⦁ Better JPEG compression
⦁ Multi\-GPU support for ML

*📚 Mobile UI/UX improvement*

Thank you all for the great feedback from the [dicussion](https://github\.com/immich\-app/immich/discussions/12597) we made a month ago about the proposed changes to the mobile app layout\. We hope the following changes will provide more fluid experience when browing and managing your photos and videos\.

*🔖 Navigation bar*

Photos and albums are the two most used pages\. To make them more accessible, we replaced the `Sharing` page with a new `Albums` page where you can find all of the album related features and functions\.

This new page allows users to quickly view, sort, search, filter, create, and manage albums\.

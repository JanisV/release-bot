And in case you missed it, we now have a ☁️ managed offering ☁️ for those who don't want to self\-host\. ~We're still in private beta \(you can signup for access [here](https://tally\.so/r/wo8zzx)\) and gradually letting more and more users in\.~ We're in public beta now and you can signup [here](https://cloud\.karakeep\.app) 🎉\.


*📌 New Features 🚀*

⦁ Collaborative lists are here\! \(\#2146, \#2152\)
  ⦁ You can now invite collaborators to your lists and manage their access levels between viewers and editors\.
  ⦁ This was the most requested feature on the roadmap, and it's now here\!
⦁ Automated bookmark backups you can schedule once and forget \(\#2182\)
  ⦁ Currently it only captures non\-asset bookmarks, but I'm planning to include lists, tags, and other metadata in the future\.
⦁ Search gets autocomplete so you can find the right filters and terms faster \(\#2178\)
⦁ Highlights overhaul: notes \+ search bar on web, plus a dedicated highlights page on mobile \(\#2154, \#2155, \#2156, \#2157\)
⦁ Mobile catches up with smart list creation and an all\-tags screen \(\#2153, \#2163\)
⦁ Crawler domain rate limiting to avoid getting throttled by external sites \(\#2115\)
  ⦁ Configure it with `CRAWLER\_DOMAIN\_RATE\_LIMIT\_WINDOW\_MS` and `CRAWLER\_DOMAIN\_RATE\_LIMIT\_MAX\_REQUESTS`\.
⦁ Import from MyMind \(\#2138\)

*📌 UX Improvements ✨*

⦁ Sidebar typography and colors should feel nicer \(specially in dark mode\)\.
⦁ Page titles are now correctly displayed in the browser tabs\.
⦁ We have a friendlier 404 page for bookmarks/lists that don't exist\.
⦁ You can now see stats about the source of your bookmarks in the usage stats page \(extension, web app, mobile app, etc\)\.

*📌 Fixes 🔧*

⦁ Prompts lazily load `js\-tiktoken` which should cut between 70\-150MB of karakeep's memory usage \(\#2176\)
⦁ The edit dialog wasn't correctly showing the extracted text from assets, this is now fixed \(\#2181\)\.
⦁ IP validation allowlisting now allows bypassing all domains by setting `CRAWLER\_ALLOWED\_INTERNAL\_HOSTNAMES` to `\.`\.
⦁ Fix a worker crash when hitting invalid URLs with proxy enabled\.

*📌 For Developers 🛠️*
⦁ GET `/api/version` endpoint for getting server version \(\#2167\)
⦁ More visibility: HTTP status Prometheus counters, failed\_permanent worker metric, and system metrics on web/worker containers \(\#2117, \#2107\)
⦁ Documentation updates for `LOG\_LEVEL` and Raycast links \(\#2166, \#1923\) by @aa\-ko and @fivestones

*✏ Changelog*

The following changelog entries focus on changes visible to users, administrators, client developers or federated software developers, but there has also been a lot of code modernization, refactoring, and tooling work, in particular by @mjankowski\.

*📚 Security*

⦁ *Add confirmation interstitial instead of silently redirecting logged\-out visitors to remote resources* \(\#27792, \#28902, and \#30651 by @ClearlyClaire and @Gargron\)\\
  This fixes a longstanding open redirect in Mastodon, at the cost of added friction when local links to remote resources are shared\.
⦁ Fix ReDoS vulnerability on some Ruby versions \([GHSA\-jpxp\-r43f\-rhvx](https://github\.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA\-jpxp\-r43f\-rhvx)\)
⦁ Change `form\-action` Content\-Security\-Policy directive to be more restrictive \(\#26897 and \#32241 by @ClearlyClaire\)
⦁ Update dependencies

*📚 Added*

⦁ *Add server\-side notification grouping* \(\#29889, \#30576, \#30685, \#30688, \#30707, \#30776, \#30779, \#30781, \#30440, \#31062, \#31098, \#31076, \#31111, \#31123, \#31223, \#31214, \#31224, \#31299, \#31325, \#31347, \#31304, \#31326, \#31384, \#31403, \#31433, \#31509, \#31486, \#31513, \#31592, \#31594, \#31638, \#31746, \#31652, \#31709, \#31725, \#31745, \#31613, \#31657, \#31840, \#31610, \#31929, \#32089, \#32085, \#32243, \#32179 and \#32254 by @ClearlyClaire, @Gargron, @mgmn, and @renchap\)\\
  Group notifications of the same type for the same target, so that your notifications no longer get cluttered by boost and favorite notifications as soon as a couple of your posts get traction\.\\
  This is done server\-side so that clients can efficiently get relevant groups without having to go through numerous pages of individual notifications\.\\
  As part of this, the visual design of the entire notifications feature has been revamped\.\\
  This feature is intended to eventually replace the existing notifications column, but for this first beta, users will have to enable it in the “Experimental features” section of the notifications column settings\.\\
  The API is not final yet, but it consists of:
  ⦁ a new `group\_key` attribute to `Notification` entities
  ⦁ `GET /api/v2/notifications`: https://docs\.joinmastodon\.org/methods/grouped\_notifications/\#get\-grouped
  ⦁ `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group\_key`: https://docs\.joinmastodon\.org/methods/grouped\_notifications/\#get\-notification\-group
  ⦁ `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group\_key/accounts`: https://docs\.joinmastodon\.org/methods/grouped\_notifications/\#get\-group\-accounts
  ⦁ `POST /api/v2/notifications/:group\_key/dimsiss`: https://docs\.joinmastodon\.org/meth

>If you're enjoying Hoarder, you can consider supporting it [here ☕️](https://buymeacoffee\.com/mbassem)\.

*📌 New Feature*

⦁ Introducing customizable tagging rules: You can now customize the prompt that we use to generate the tags to your linkings and add custom rules for the LLM to adhere to\!
  ⦁ You can use this to define your tagging rules in natural language and let the LLM take care of applying it\.
⦁ If you don't want to enable "Full page archives" by default, you can now selectively archive particular pages that you want to keep forever thanks to @kamtschatka\!
⦁ You can now export your bookmarks from Hoarder and re\-import them back in another instance \(note: currently images and pdfs are not exported\)\.
⦁ You can now customize the context length of the inference model using the `INFERENCE\_CONTEXT\_LENGTH` flag:
  ⦁ The bigger this value is, the more of your content the model will see and will be able to give you better tagging\.
  ⦁ However, the bigger the context window, the more expensive the request is for OpenAI money\-wise and for ollama resource\-wise\.
  ⦁ The current default is `2048` tokens \(\~2048 words\)\.
⦁ Better asset tracking and management:
  ⦁ We're now currently correctly accounting for all asset sizes in the database\. You can view the usage of every user now in the admin panel\.
  ⦁ Old assets are not automatically accounted for and you'll have to click the new `Compact Asset` button in the admin panel to backfill that data\. This button also removes assets that are dangling \(aka not linked to any bookmark\)\.
  ⦁ This work is in preparation for supporting better privacy checks in the future when we implement public and collaborative lists\.
⦁ You can now attach custom image banners to your notes\.
  ⦁ Those banners will appear at the top of your notes when you expand them as well as in the `List` layout\.
  ⦁ We're still figuring out a good way to render them in the grid and masonry layouts\.

*📌 UX Improvements*

⦁ We have a refreshed UI looks thanks to amazing designs by @Lucius346346\!
  ⦁ We now have a sticky navbar for better experience in bulk editing thanks to @mdsaban\.
  ⦁ We also have a new profile options dropdown in the header where the user and admin settings buttons got moved to\.
⦁ We now have infinite scrolling for pagination so that you no longer need to click the `Show more` button\.
⦁ Bulk actions improvements:
  ⦁ There's now a `Select all` button to select all the currently visible bookmarks\.
  ⦁ `Copy links` is also a thing to bulk copy the source links of a bunch of bookmarks thanks to @kamtschatka\.
⦁ You can now trigger AI tag regeneration for all bookmarks or the ones that that failed only in the admin panel\.
⦁ When you hoard text from other webpages by the extension \(by highlighting text \-\> right click \-\> add to hoarder\) the source link will now be preserved with the text\.
⦁ We have a new tabbed user settings page as it was getting quite long\.
⦁ Sidebar items were not clickable around the boarder which was annoying\. @Trugamr fixed that\!

*📌 Fixes*
